# Brews & Beats
This Entertainment Planning App provides users event options and venues in the city, state, and time frame of their choice.

## Motivation 
Planning a night out in an unfamilar area can be difficult and invovles searching across multiple websites.  Brews & Beats gives users important information about multiple events/breweries all on one platform.
